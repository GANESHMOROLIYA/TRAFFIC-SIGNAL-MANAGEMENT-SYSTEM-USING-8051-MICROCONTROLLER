# TRAFFIC-SIGNAL-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-USING-8051-MICROCONTROLLER
 we made this project in our  Engineering 3rd year 5th semester in Microcontroller and Interfacing Subject
 Traffic control is the big issue in today’s era. Traffic jam is one of the major problems in  densely populated 
cities whereas their population and number of running vehicles are much more than their capacity. Faulty 
traffic signaling systems, inadequate manpower, narrow road spaces and overtaking tendency of drivers create 
pro-longed traffic jams. Due to traffic jam a substantial portion of working hours have to be left on streets 
which indirectly put adverse impact on economy and unavoidable road accident which results loss of lives. 
The number of vehicles is ever increasing while the city infrastructures are developing at a much slower rate. 
The management of traffic is also a tough job and only manual efforts can ’t stop this kind of problem so we 
need machines. Today’s traffic control system is able to handle such a situation. We need a system which is 
dynamic in nature so that it can handle traffic smoothly and such a system called Automatic Traffic Control 
System. Here we are creating the same dynamic traffic control system which has the ability to control the 
traffic as well as avoid the congestion of roads. Traffic Light system was one of the fascinating applications 
of Embedded systems and have been using the same till this day. This is the four-way traffic light system using 
embedded systems which was bit simple in nature as we need to consider the traffic flow in four different 
directions providing appropriate timings to each of the lights. This system uses 8051 microcontroller, Seven 
Segment Display and LEDs for indication. This is the simplest and cheapest model of automatic traffic light 
controller using microcontroller 8051. 


WORKING 
This automatic traffic light control system operates as an open-loop control system, meaning it doesn't rely on 
feedback for adjustment. Instead, it's equipped with several key components that work harmoniously to ensure 
the efficient management of traffic signals. At its core, the system employs an 8051 microcontroller, which 
acts as the central control unit, overseeing the entire operation. To communicate timing information to vehicle 
users and pedestrians, a 7-segment display is employed, while LEDs are used to indicate stop and go signals. 
Upon system initialization, a 10-second countdown sequence is initiated and presented on the 7-segment 
display, counting down from 9 to 0. Simultaneously, the traffic signals are activated, with three sides 
displaying red signals and one side showing a green signal. What sets this system apart is its precision in 
timing. The program is meticulously designed to ensure a 30-second duration for the red signal and a 10
second window for the green signal before seamlessly transitioning to the next phase of the traffic light cycle. 
The inclusion of the 7-segment display serves a dual purpose. First, it enhances the convenience of road users 
by providing real-time information about the time remaining before the traffic signal changes. Secondly, the 
system's countdown feature contributes to improved road safety by alerting drivers and pedestrians to signal 
changes in advance. 
In summary, this intelligently engineered system operates as an efficient and highly reliable automatic traffic 
light controller, ensuring the systematic and safe regulation of vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Its open-loop 
design, precise timing, and user-friendly features collectively contribute to enhanced road safety and effective 
traffic management.
